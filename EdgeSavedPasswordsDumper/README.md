## EdgeSavedPasswordsDumper
*A small educational tool demonstrating that Edge stores credentials in cleartext in process memory.*

---

## Overview
This project is a simple C#/.NET 3.5 tool created to demonstrate that Edge stores credentials in cleartext in memory. It is intended for **educational and research purposes only**, especially for understanding memory inspection, credential handling, and security design differences across software.

I am **not an experienced C# developer**, so the code may contain rough edges, inefficiencies, or non‑idiomatic patterns. Contributions, improvements, and suggestions are welcome.

## Purpose
This tool was created to show that whenever a user stores credentials in Edge (using the Microsoft Password Manager feature, e.g. Autofill), ALL credentials are stored in plaintext in the parent Edge process memory. This is obviously problematic in a shared environment (e.g. on a terminal servers) as an attacker can access **all** Edge processes for **all** logged on and disconnected users, and dump their saved credentials.
Microsoft has said that this is "by design" and thus won't fix this.
The tool is meant to support learning, responsible disclosure, and security awareness — not misuse.
